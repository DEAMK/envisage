Introduction
============

Welcome to the Envisage Project! The goal of Envisage is to provide a framework
for building extensible, pluggable applications, and in particular (but not
limited to!), extensible, pluggable applications for scientists and engineers.

The project is really divided into 3 sub-projects:-

1) A framework for extensible applications

   The core of Envisage (the enthought.envisage package) provides the basic
   notions of extensibility and plugins. All of the other sub-projects are
   simply collections of plugins that are built using this layer.

2) A framework for (Graphical) User Interface applications

   This is small (but hopefully expanding) set of plugins for building
   applications with (graphical) User Interfaces (UIs). It is found in the
   enthought.envisage.ui package (and its subpackages), and aims to provide
   (eventually!) much of the functionality commonly required in user
    interfaces (actions, menubars, toolbars, user preferences, wizards etc).

3) A framework for Scientific/Engineering applications

   This is the holy grail, and in truth, we haven't got much here yet, but the
   goal is to build up a set of plugins targeted towards scientific and
   engineering applications (data import/export, 2D/3D visualization etc).

Before we go any other futher, we should point out that Envisage is based
*heavily* on the excellent work that has been done in the Java community on
frameworks such as OSGi_, Eclipse_ (which is built on top of OSGi_) and
NetBeans_. Like these other frameworks, Envisage helps you build applications
that are extensible via the concept of plugins, however, one of its main goals
is to provide a simplified system so that applications and plugins can be
written by scientists and engineers i.e. people whose full-time job is *not*
necessarily software development. In order to meet this goal, Envisage
obviously has to make some compromises, and so if you want to build a massively
scaleable, enterprise application we suggest you start with one of those other
projects!

Lets take a look at the Envisage core in more detail (the other sub-projects
are discussed in their own documentation sections - should they exist ;^).

1) A framework for extensible applications
------------------------------------------

The Envisage core framework provides implementations of 3 simple concepts to
help you build your extensible applications. Each of these concepts is
discussed in detail in the following sections:

1) `Extension Points`_
2) Services_
3) Plugins_

To help make these somewhat abstract notions a little more concrete, lets take
a look at a simple example, the `Message of the Day`_ application.
