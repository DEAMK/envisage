Welcome to Envisage
-------------------

Welcome to Envisage - an Extensible Application Framework for Python!

Envisage allows you to build applications that are extensible via the concept
of plugins. 

Envisage is treading lightly in the footsteps of the fantastic work that has
been done in the Java community on frameworks such as OSGi_, Eclipse_ (which is
built on top of OSGi_) and NetBeans_.

Like these other frameworks, Envisage helps you build applications that are
extensible via the concept of plugins. The plugin model is simple yet
powerful and allowsPlugins can contribute toThere are 3 simple concepts thatmain con

to help you build applications based on a plugin model.

Envisage applications are built using a plugin model that allows them to be
easily and rapidly extended with new functionality.applications to be easily

One of the problems that all of these frameworks face however

The following sections attempt to answer some of the questions that often
arise when the words 'Extensible', 'Application' and 'Framework' appear
next to each other.

However, before doing that, we should point out that the ideas behind Envisage
are not new. They are not even ours. The project is heavily influenced by the
fantastic work that has been done in the Java community on application
frameworks such as OSGi, Eclipe, and NetBeans. Envisage is merely treading
lightly in their footsteps.

Extensible?
-----------

Whether or not we as software developers like to admit it, most (if not all) of
the applications we write need to change over time. We fix bugs, and we add, 
modify and remove features. In other words, we spend most of our time either
fixing or extending our applications.

Sometimes we extend our applications by changing the actual code. Sometimes
we have other ad hoc extension mechanisms in place -- a text file here,
a directory of scripts there. As applications grow, they often end up with
numerous places where they can be extended, but with a different extension
mechanism at each one. This makes it hard for developers who want to extend
the application to know a) *where* they can add extensions, and b) *how*
to add them.

Envisage attempts to address this problem by admitting up front that 
applications need to be extensible, and by providing a standard way for
developers to advertise the places where extension can occur (known as
*extension points*), and for other developers to make *contributions* to them.

In Envisage, extension points and the contributions made to them are stored
in the *extension registry*. Envisage is designed such that you can implement
your own extension registry, but by default, it uses an implementation based
on the entry points mechanism of Python Eggs [fixme: ref]. More details about
the extension registry can be found in section [fixme: ref].

Application?
------------

In Envisage terms, an application is simply a collection of cooperating
objects (known as *services*). Services often represent the functional
subsystems of an application, although they are simply objects that a developer
considers sufficiently useful to want to share them.

In Envisage, services are published and looked up using the *service registry*.
The service registry provides a 'yellow pages' style mechanism (i.e. it is a
bit like looking up a telephone number in the yellow pages!) in that services
are published and looked up by *type*. For example, say I have some object that
provides a plumber service, I can register it using an *IPlumber* interface.
When some other part of the application springs leak, it can find a plumber by
looking up all of the services that offer the *IPlumber* interface. More
details about using the service registry can be found in section `Using Services`_.

Framework?
----------

The Envisage framework brings together the notions of extension points
and services using the concept of *plugins*. Plugins simply provide a way to
deliver extension points, contributions, and services into an application.

In Envisage, plugins are located and managed by the *plugin manager*. Once
again, Envisage is designed such that you can implement your own plugin
manager, but by default, it uses an implementation based on Python Eggs. More
details about the plugin manager can be found in section [fixme: ref].

Terminology
===========

Let's recap the Envisage terminology that has been introduced so far:

Extension Point
  A well defined place where new functionality and/or data can be contributed
  to an application.

Extension (aka Contribution)
  An *actual* piece of functionality or data that is contributed (this is why
  extensions are often known as contributions). Think of
  'extension points' as the 'where' and 'extensions' as the 'what'.

Extension Registry
  The place where (by default) all of the extension points and their 
  associated extensions are stored.

Service
  In Envisage, a service is *any* object that a developer thinks is sufficiently
  useful that to want to share it. While this term can have more specialized 
  meanings in related contexts, don't read too much into the word 'service' 
  when talking about Envisage.

Service Registry
  The 'yellow pages' style mechanism that is used to publish and look up
  services.

Plugin
  The mechanism for delivering new functionality to an application. A plugin
  can do 3 simple things:

  1) offer extension points
  2) make contributions to extension points (including its own)
  3) create and publish services

Plugin Manager
  Finds, starts, and manages the plugins that make up the application.

And that is it! Once you understand these ideas you understand Envisage -- so
lets get started with a simple example that will hopefully make these somewhat
abstract concepts a little more concrete.
