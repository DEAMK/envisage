Core
====

The goal of the *Core* project is to provide a set of general-purpose tools
for building extensible, pluggable applications. Hopefully, these tools are
useful whether you are building an airline reservation system, a web server or
a game of tetris!

Generally, when we try to represent an Envisage application visually, we draw
something like this:

.. image:: images/application.png

Which attempts to illustrate the 3 simple concepts used to build *all*
Envisage applications:

1) `Extension Points`_
2) Services_
3) Plugins_

.. _`Extension Points`: ExtensionPoints.html
.. _`Plugins`: Plugins.html
.. _`Services`: Services.html
