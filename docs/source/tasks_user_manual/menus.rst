 Menus and Toolbars
====================

In addition to specifying a layout of panes, a task can include a menu bar, a
status bar, and any number of tool bars. In this section, we shall see how the
Tasks framework supports these important user interface elements.

Conceptually, it is important to recall that a task is a kind of *blueprint* for
a user interface. As such, a task can provide blueprints, or *schemas* as we
shall henceforth call them, for menus and tool bars, but does not itself contain
menu or tool bar controls. It may not seem that this distinct is very important
to us in the present section, but it will take on considerable importance in the
subsequent section on :ref:`extensibility`.
